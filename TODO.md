# TODO.md - Geminpy Porting & Refactoring Plan

## Overview

Port the monolithic `work/gemini_wrapper.py` script into a well-structured Python package `geminpy` with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive testing, and modern Python best practices.

## Phase 1: âœ… COMPLETED

- [x] Address `issues/101.txt` - Fixed OAuth button detection to handle multiple languages
- [x] In our CLI add `-P` / `--Pro` as a shortcut for `-m 'gemini-2.5-pro'` and `-F` / `--Flash` as a shortcut for `-m 'gemini-2.5-flash'` (that is, our CLI takes these args and puts the -m nnnn into the gemini args)
