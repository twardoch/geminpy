Record all recent changes in CHANGELOG.md. 

Run `npx repomix -o ./llms.txt .` and analyze the entire codebase (./llms.txt ). Into PLAN.md, make an extensive detailed step-by-step itemized plan that discusses at length how to streamline the code. 

Then write a simplified `- [ ]` prefixed list of that plan into TODO.md. 

Then re-read PLAN.md and TODO.md, and start implementing. Record all changes in CHANGELOG.md and keep updating PLAN.md and TODO.md to reflect the progress. 

Implement all changes that lead to a well-functioning, elegant, efficient project. Keep documentation and the build tooling in sync with the codebase.
